I’m Kalyan Eluri, a full-stack developer who enjoys breaking down real problems and turning them into practical web solutions.    
I enjoy building complete features — backend logic, frontend flow, and everything in between.

Currently focused on strengthening fundamentals, writing better code each day, and learning through hands-on projects 🚀



## 🎯 Motivations & Interests


I’m driven by the challenge of solving meaningful problems and building systems that feel intuitive to use.  
From structuring backend logic to refining frontend interactions, I enjoy understanding how different pieces come together.

💡 **What fuels me:**

- Building applications that solve real-world problems  
- Turning ideas into clean, production-ready features  
- Continuously learning, experimenting, and improving my craft
