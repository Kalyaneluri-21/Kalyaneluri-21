## 👋 About Me

I’m Kalyan Eluri, a full-stack developer who enjoys breaking down real problems and turning them into practical web solutions.    
I enjoy building complete features — backend logic, frontend flow, and everything in between.

Currently focused on strengthening fundamentals, writing better code each day, and learning through hands-on projects 🚀


🎯 Motivations & Interests

I enjoy working on problems that require thinking beyond just writing code — understanding the “why”, then building solutions that actually make sense to use.
Whether it’s structuring backend logic, improving frontend interactions, or refining how different parts of an app work together, I like focusing on the details.

💡 What keeps me motivated:

Building applications that solve real, practical problems
Learning new tools by applying them in real projects
Continuously improving code quality and system design
